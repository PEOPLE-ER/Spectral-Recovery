# 1. INTRODUCTION
##  1.1 ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION

 Increased disturbances and degradation of natural environments are resulting in greater global emphasis placed on monitoring, protecting, and improving ecosystems. As a result, ecosystem restoration efforts are becoming more widespread, which aim to restore an area to a specified condition, and can involve passive, active, or hybrid regeneration techniques (Burnett et al., 2019; Hobbs & Norton, 1996).

Restoration has proven to be an effective tool to reverse ecosystem damage, while also increasing ecosystem resilience through greater biodiversity as a result (Wortley et al., 2013). At the same time, an important outcome of restoration interventions has often been an increased functionality of ecosystems, and a greater availability of ecosystem goods and services (Atkinson et al., 2022; Hobbs & Norton, 1996). Because of the numerous potential benefits, the specific goals of restoration may differ between sites and can include other aspects like carbon storage or timber quality, with restoration techniques often tailored to reach those specific goals (Burnett et al., 2019). Depending on the restoration goals, the success of the ecosystem recovery is usually determined by measures of one or more categories of ecosystem characteristics: vegetation structure, biodiversity, and ecological functioning (Ruiz-Jaen & Mitchell Aide, 2005).

 Monitoring restoration efforts typically involve field measurements, which can be expensive and unfeasible, especially if the restoration site is inaccessible or if it covers large spatial extents. Especially challenging is the ability to repeat the field measurements over time, to ensure that restoration is still on track. These limitations often result in an incomplete understanding of the recovery process, with most restoration monitoring programs having durations of five years or less (Ruiz-Jaen & Mitchell Aide, 2005). Yet recovery often occurs on much longer timescales, with biodiversity and structural regeneration requiring upwards of seven years to show progress (Chen et al., 2011; Pickell et al., 2016; Atkinson et al., 2022).

 Remote sensing offers a solution to these limitations, with open satellite imagery allowing consistent, inexpensive, and repeatable measurements of ground conditions at a landscape scale (Cordell et al., 2017).  While remote sensing has not been used as frequently as field measurements, this is because restoration has historically taken place at fine-scale site-specific resolutions (Cordell et al., 2017). However, the increased emphasis on ecosystem restoration and management being landscape-focused (Cordell et al., 2017) makes remote sensing highly applicable to restoration monitoring frameworks.

##  1.2 USING SPECTRAL INDICES TO MONITOR RESTORATION OUTCOMES

Freely available satellite imagery has resulted in advancements in the use of remote sensing data products and algorithms for monitoring the conditions of vegetation (Wulder et al. 2012), with a substantial number of analyses depending on spectral indices. Sometimes referred to as vegetation indices, spectral indices use reflectance from two or more spectral bands to produce an estimate of vegetation health (Zeng et al., 2022). Spectral indices have long been used as proxies for vegetation conditions (Banskota et al. 2014) and are correlated to ecosystem variables, such as ecosystem structure or function (Skidmore et al. 2021), enabling their use in estimating ecosystem recovery.

 Spectral indices are commonly used in time series analyses (Banskota et al. 2014). Time series analyses use multispectral images from different dates in time and record how spectral indices have changed, resulting in a spectral trajectory. By revealing how spectral indices have changed (in other words, by using the trajectories), it enables the characterization of changes in vegetation due to disturbance, recovery, or both (Wulder et al. 2019). Subsequently, one can use these trajectories to calculate change metrics, such as change magnitude or change duration (Banskota et al. 2014; Wulder et al. 2019). Recent developments in the use of spectral information for ecosystem recovery detection have also resulted in a variety of recovery metrics that have proven to be useful for characterizing recovery specifically, such as Years to Recovery (Y2R) (Wulder et al. 2019; Frazier et al. 2018, De Keersmaecker et al. 2022). Along with these metrics, change algorithms have also been developed, however these are often complex, require parameterization, and are inaccessible to users unfamiliar with remote sensing or statistics (Cohen et al. 2018).

## 1.3 TOOL OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE

The objective of the PEOPLE-ER Spectral Recovery tool is to provide an open-source and satellite earth observation (EO) time series data analytics solution for ecosystem restoration research and monitoring purposes, which operates with freely available Sentinel-2 or Landsat satellite imagery. It provides flexible methods for satellite EO data time series analysis, by providing users with the ability to select from a variety of spectral indices and recovery metrics as well as define reference or baseline conditions. The aim is to provide custom analyses ideal for widespread applications beyond site-specific contexts, with flexible reference conditions enabling direct integration with current ecosystem restoration initiatives and guidelines. The ability to calculate multiple per-pixel indices also provides remote sensing experts or researchers with the ability to easily produce spectrally derived products useful for further analysis. The project aims to provide a tool such that the monitoring of restoration is more accessible to a variety of users, enabling computation of indices and metrics by users that do not necessarily have a background in remote sensing. In providing a singular solution, spectral time series analysis becomes more approachable, increasing the opportunity to apply remote sensing techniques to ecosystem restoration monitoring.

## 1.4 TOOL WORKFLOW

 In simple terms, the tool operates using the following method:

1. Using satellite imagery, spectral indices are calculated for each pixel within each restoration site, for each year of the time series. This results in each pixel having a set of spectral trajectories through time.

1. Based on these, the tool compares the spectral trajectories to a recovery target (defined from the period prior to disturbance or a reference location).

1. Recovery metrics for each pixel are calculated based on the recovery trajectory and the recovery target. This informs on how well each pixel is recovering after disturbances or during the restoration process.

# 2. RESTORATION AND RECOVERY IN PRACTICE

This section provides an overview of current knowledge surrounding ecosystem restoration and recovery, what a trajectory of spectral recovery may look like, and factors that may influence restoration success.

##  2.1 LOOKING AT RECOVERY

 Generally, there are two main components of recovery that should be considered: recovery rate and recovery trajectory or shape (Montoya, 2021). Recovery rates and trajectories are often considered in remote sensing analyses, but they are hard to estimate when using ground data. This is primarily because revealing the rate and trajectory shape require repeated measurements of the conditions, which would be expensive to monitor using field data. Yet, recovery rates and trajectories reveal substantial information about the progress of the recovery, as it shows not only how quickly a site is recovering, but also how that rate is changing over time. It is this information offered by rates and trajectories that can be used for the calculation of recovery metrics, which consequently offer more information about recovery progress than a simple index value.

  ![image](asset/historical_trends_exmpl.png)

_Figure 2. Displays two conceptual spectral recovery trajectories, following a disturbance and using a historical recovery target on the left, and following a restoration intervention with a reference recovery target on the right._

A second consideration is timescales. There can be short-term and long-term recovery indicators, with some spectral indices providing information about short-term recovery and some indices providing more information about long-term recovery. For example, NDVI often increases quite quickly in the restoration process as it is sensitive to vegetation like grasses and shrubs, which often establish themselves rapidly after a disturbance (Hislop et al. 2018; Pickell et al. 2016). However, NDVI also saturates or plateaus at ~~higher~~ relatively low biomass densities (Chu et al. 2016; Pickell et al. 2016; White et al. 2017), so it may not provide much information as a long-term recovery indicator. NBR, on the other hand, has been shown to correlate more with vegetation structure, and is thus often used to estimate the re-establishment of trees or woody vegetation, as opposed to grasses (Frazier et al. 2015; Hislop et al. 2018; Pickell et al. 2016; White et al. 2017). Both indices provide complementary insight into a site's recovery progress, and it is recommended to look at both short-term and long-term recovery indicators for this reason. More information about spectral indices can be found in the Spectral Indices section.

Recovery trajectories following restoration can be variable, often being a nonlinear process that experiences interannual variation (Ruiz-Jaen & Mitchell Aide, 2005). In fact, the first five years of a restoration project may see highly divergent trajectories across the site, due to stochasticity, variations in climate, and other highly localized environmental variables and processes (Matthews & Spyreas, 2010). This is especially true with the increasingly rapid changes to climates under the global climate crisis (Suding et al., 2015). Because of this interannual variation, a trajectory may change year-to-year, which is why it is recommended to run the tool annually to assess the recovery progress. However, it is also expected that there will be variability in the spectral trajectories, and a decreased recovery rate for a single year may not be cause for concern.

Spectral trajectories often differ with disturbance severity and disturbance types (Schroeder et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2011; Chu et al. 2016; Bright et al. 2019). Or they might differ with local environmental variables, such as the amount of precipitation that is received, or differences in previous land cover, soils, nutrient availabilities, and ecosystem types (Epting & Verbyla 2005; Frolking et al. 2009; Kennedy et al. 2012; Frazier et al. 2015). Spectral trajectories can also vary by forest type or dominant species (Frazier et al. 2015; Bright et al., 2019). For example, in their study, Morresi et al. 2019 found that broadleaved trees recovery more quickly than conifers. Spectral indices will also display different trajectories (Pickell et al. 2016; Cohen et al. 2018) so it is important to consider what information each index offers as an ecological indicator, and be aware of its limitations. Altogether these differences indicate a key reason why this tool, which monitors individual areas through time using multiple indices, is necessary for understanding forest restoration and recovery, as generalizations across both time and space cannot be made.

## 2.2 FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT RESTORATION SUCCESS

 The success of restoration efforts may be dependent on the scale of the disturbance. For instance, areas that still maintain some characteristics of their natural state (e.g., semi-natural systems) generally are able to transition back to a stable state (Hobbs & Norton 1996). However, disturbances such as clear-cut harvesting, mining operations, and severe wildfires result in systems which are significantly different from either historic or reference conditions, which may negatively affect the restoration outcomes or increase the time needed for the restoration to be successful (Atkinson et al., 2022). Historic land use may also influence restoration success, as soil fertility and seed banks will affect the successional dynamics of the ecosystem (Atkinson et al., 2022). Additionally, climate can play a role in the success of restoration, as areas subject to drought may result in water-stressed vegetation with stunted growth (Kennedy et al. 2012). It may be useful to stratify the tool outputs using other external variable layers, such as climate, restoration treatments, and disturbance severity, to aid in the identification of possible recovery trends driven by such factors.

# 3. TOOL INPUTS

Necessary inputs for the tool include a time series composite, one or more restoration sites, a selection of spectral indices, and a selection of recovery metrics. An optional input to the tool is one or more reference sites. These inputs are explained below, and more information concerning the formats required for the tool inputs can be found in the tool's Technical Documentation.

## 3.1 TIME SERIES COMPOSITE

A time series composite must be:

- Landsat-derived – The spectral index calculations currently only support Landsat imagery. It is recommended that the time series composite be derived using Landsat Collection 2, Level 2, Tier 1 data, as this data is pre-processed prior with necessary corrections and represents the highest quality data available. See ([https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2)) for further information. While the tool currently only supports Landsat imagery, further development of the tool will soon result in the ability to use Sentinel-2 imagery.

- Multi-spectral – The spectral index calculations depend on reflectance bands beyond the visible light spectrum. The time series composite must have the following bands: blue, green, red, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrareds 1 and 2 (SWIR1 and SWIR2).
- Annual – The tool requires a maximum of one image per year, as the calculation of the recovery metrics depend on an annual timestep.
- Cloud-free – The time series composite should have been pre-processed to ensure that pixels containing clouds and snow have been removed. A commonly used algorithm is Fmask (Zhu et al. 2015), however there are numerous cloud-masking algorithms available for different software.

## 3.2 RESTORATION SITES

The tool accepts one restoration site, as a vector file (see technical documentation for further information). Restoration site polygons delineate the areas that are intended to be assessed for recovery or health (i.e., areas of disturbance). Each restoration site polygon will have the spectral indices calculated, and recovery metrics will be returned.

 Recommendations:

-  Larger restoration site polygons (containing 1000s of pixels) will be expected to have within site variability in vegetation conditions and recovery rates. The tool allows for raster-based visualization of indicators, but the spectral recovery graphs are per-polygon and will show the average for the site. Since recovery is often variable even within a small area, it is recommended to consider the size of the polygons for the analysis. It may be beneficial to stratify a single large restoration polygon into multiple smaller polygons. This may be more effective for revealing distinct trends, reduce variability of the recovery metrics for polygons, and provide more information about spatial heterogeneity. This means that it is also easier to identify areas of the landscape that may be recovering faster or slower than average.

- When stratifying a larger polygon into multiple polygons, consider using factors that are expected to influence recovery, e.g., disturbance severity, climate, and pre-disturbance land cover or conditions (Atkinson et al., 2022), it may be useful to stratify the polygons according to one or more of these factors.

## 3.3 SPECTRAL INDICES

The tool requires a list of spectral indices that should be calculated. Currently, the tool offers numerous indices (14 at this stage of development). As many or as few as desired can be calculated, with different indices offering different information concerning the status of vegetation on the ground. A general introduction to spectral indices as well as information concerning each index included in the tool can be found in the Spectral Indices section below.

## 3.4 RECOVERY METRICS

The tool calculates the selected recovery metrics as identified in an input list. Recovery metrics are calculated for each pixel in the restoration polygons, for each spectral index chosen. Further information about each of the metrics offered can be found in the Recovery Metrics section below.

## 3.5 REFERENCE SITES

The tool accepts an optional input of one or more reference sites, as vector files (see technical documentation for further information). Reference site polygons delineate the areas that are intended to be used to determine the recovery target. In other words, these are areas of the landscape which are known to either be relatively healthy, stable, or have desired traits, which the restoration sites will be compared against. Each reference site polygon will have the spectral indices calculated, and the average value across the reference sites for each spectral index will be the recovery target value for that index. If no reference sites are provided, the recovery target is calculated via the default historical method (i.e., using average historical spectral values of the restoration site).

See the Recovery Target section for recommendations on selecting reference sites, and for more information about how the recovery target is determined.

# 4. RECOVERY TARGET

A necessary component of monitoring restoration success is having an appropriate recovery target for a restoration site (Hobbs & Norton, 1996; Ruiz-Jaen & Mitchell Aide, 2005). In the field of ecological restoration, it is expected to have clearly defined and measurable target ecosystem attributes (Hobbs & Norton, 1996), which identify the degree of recovery desired for the degraded area (Gann et al., 2019). The most common approach for measuring restoration success, is to measure the similarity between the restoration site and these recovery targets (Hobbs & Norton, 1996). The field of remote sensing also frequently estimates restoration success by assessing similarity of a restoration site to a recovery target condition, via the comparison of spectral index values to pre-disturbance conditions (Frazier et al. 2018; White et al. 2017).

In ecosystem restoration monitoring, target ecosystem attributes typically fall into one or more of three major categories: biodiversity, vegetation structure, and ecological processes (Ruiz-Jaen & Mitchell Aide, 2005; Wortley et al. 2013). While remote sensing using satellite imagery relies on monitoring using spectral indices, these have been shown to be relevant in estimating these ecosystem attributes; Skidmore et al. (2021) outlined a framework that connects remotely sensed products derived from spectral indices (i.e., land cover), to remote sensing variables, (i.e., habitat structure), to ecosystem variable classes such as ecosystem structure. Another example is the derivation of leaf area index (LAI) from spectral data, which is used to estimate the condition of ecosystem physiology, thus revealing information about ecosystem function (Skidmore et al. 2021). These developments allow for more frequent applications of remotely sensed measurable and standardized spectral index values, to quantifiable and ecologically meaningful ground recovery targets.

This tool provides customization, as it allows recovery targets to be set with two common approaches outlined below.

## 4.1 DETERMINING THE RECOVERY TARGET USING A HISTORICAL APPROACH

A historical approach uses a historical condition of a restoration site as the recovery target. This is the most common approach in the field of remote sensing, with the readily available satellite imagery in the Landsat archives dating back to 1984 making it possible to select a historical recovery target. Support for this approach has grown as there has been increasing freely available historic satellite imagery, with Sentinel-2 imagery's earliest historical period being 2016. In annual time series trajectory analyses, the recovery target is frequently set by taking the average spectral value of the two years prior to the start of the disturbance (Pickell et al. 2016; White et al. 2017; De Keersmaecker et al. 2022). As spectral trajectories can be noisy and subject to interannual variation, the average is taken to represent the general pre-disturbance condition and offset any potential noise in the spectral trajectory of those two years (Pickell et al., 2016). This logic is the basis of the default recovery target method used in the tool, however this default method can be customized to fit each application. Custom options include the ability to manually set the timeframe (when and how many years) before the disturbance that is used to calculate the average historic condition. This could be useful to parameterize if the disturbance was gradual instead of sudden and so no exact disturbance dates exist, or if it is known due to historical, traditional, or local knowledge when the forest was in a desirable state.

## 4.2 DETERMINING THE RECOVERY TARGET USING A REFERENCE APPROACH

A recommended approach for determining recovery targets within the field of ecological restoration is the use of reference systems (Gann et al., 2019). Reference systems are areas within the same landscape of the restoration site which exhibit desirable ecosystem attributes and represent a healthy or stable ecosystem condition (Gann et al., 2019). These are often attributed to be natural or semi-natural ecosystems which could have been similar to the restoration site's state if not for the site's degradation or disturbance (Gann et al., 2019). The use of reference systems is built on the recognition that within an ecosystem, there are multiple possible meta-states depending on environmental drivers such as climate or species which may affect the successional dynamics, and that ecosystems are always in a state of change (Gann et al., 2019; Hobbs & Norton, 1996). Ecological restoration frameworks strongly encourage the use of reference systems over historical conditions, as the latter target might be impossible or even undesirable to reach. This is primarily due to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions, especially in the context of climate change and the importance of ecosystem resilience (Gann et al., 2019). Yet, to determine restoration successful, a target is still required which is where reference systems become integral.

Building off the same logic of multiple possible meta-states, constantly changing ecosystems, and natural variability in ecosystem processes, ecological restoration practitioners are also recommended to use multiple reference systems. Using a single reference system alone can constrain the restoration efforts and complicate the measure of success; Particularly if the reference state is not attainable for the restoration site – which may be likely if it becomes subject to degradation itself (Hobbs & Norton, 1996). By incorporating a number of reference systems into the recovery target, it allows for a range of dynamic conditions making restoration success more feasible (Hobbs & Norton, 1996). It also helps to avoid any potential bias in reference system selection, as choosing one may result in only the highest quality site being chosen (which may be unattainable) or failure to include systems that that experience the same conditions as the restoration site (Atkinson et al. 2022).

The Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) is a global non-profit organization with 70 member countries, which has been influential in determining international restoration guidelines, frameworks, and principles since 2004 (Gann et al., 2019). In addition to encouraging the use of reference systems for the purpose of increasing ecosystem resilience to climate change, SER also suggests taking a landscape approach to identifying reference systems (Gann et al., 2019). Because degradation frequently results in habitat fragmentation, and biodiversity has been shown to increase ecosystem resilience, the choice of reference systems should account for increasing landscape heterogeneity or habitat availability (Gann et al., 2019; Hobbs & Norton, 1996). This means that choosing a reference system could be aided by taking a landscape approach and identifying what is needed for the landscape's health as a whole. Subsequently, a landscape approach can maximize beneficial outcomes for management and enables consideration of multiple goals at varying spatial scales (Hobbs & Norton 1996).

The tool's reference approach to determining a recovery target is similar to the historical approach in that it uses the values of spectral indices. However, instead of taking the average value of pre-disturbance conditions, the recovery target is determined by the average index value across the reference sites at the current timestep. This means that the recovery progress of the restoration site is compared to the current and contextual conditions within the landscape.

Recommendations:

- In areas that have seen large landscape disturbances, there may be a lack of appropriate reference systems. In that case, it is recommended to use areas that have either seen the least disturbance or degradation, or areas which have had the longest time to recover.
- Consider keystone species, as selection of reference systems or restoration goals could be guided by the necessary conditions for their survival. Encouraging keystone species survival can result in positive cascading effects, requiring less management efforts and restoration activities long-term (Decleer & Bijlsma 2021; Montoya 2021).
- Often it is tempting to pick only the very highest quality reference sites, however these are often areas which are relatively undisturbed which may provide biased and/or unattainable targets (Atkinson et al. 2022). They could fail to experience the actual range of conditions seen in the restoration site or they could include entirely different target ecological communities (Atkinson et al. 2022). Try to select areas which have similar histories (e.g., land cover) as well as similar micro-climates.

- Select multiple reference systems to provide a dynamic range of ecosystem attributes for the recovery targets.

# 5. RECOVERY METRICS

Recovery metrics allow for the characterization or spectral trends through time, using the spectral trajectories to result in standardized and comparable numeric variables (Wulder et al. 2019). There are five recovery metrics currently implemented within the tool, which are each informed by previous research (De Keersmaecker et al., 2022; Frazier et al., 2018; Pickell et al., 2016; White et al., 2017).

| Variable  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| Ds  | Index value: Disturbance start  |
| De  | Index value: Disturbance end  |
| Dpre  | Index value: Pre-disturbance (average of 2 years prior to Ds)  |
| Daverage  | Index value: average value from Ds to De  |
| R0  | Index value: Restoration start (usually 1 year after De)  |
| Ri  | Index value: years after R0, subscripts indicate the # of years  |
| Rcurrent  | Index value: current time step or last year of time series  |
| Rtarget  | Index value: recovery target  |
| Rslope  | Recovery slope/rate  |
| P  | Percent, user-defined, default is 80  |
| t  | Years/time step  |

| Metric | Formula | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ∆Indexregrowth |***R<sub>i</sub>−R<sub>0</sub> Default: R<sub>5</sub>−R<sub>0</sub>***| The absolute change in a spectral index's value at a point in the restoration monitoring window from the start of the restoration monitoring window. The default is the change that has occurred 5 years into the restoration from the start of the restoration.|
| YrYr(Year on year average) |$R_i - R_0 \over \Delta _t R_i - R_0$ <br /> Default: <br /> $R_5 - R_0 \over 5$| The average annual recovery rate relative to a fixed time interval during the restoration monitoring window. The default is the first 5 years of the restoration window, however this can be changed by specifying the index value at a specific time step (Ri). |
| R80P (Ratio of 80 percent) |$Rcurrent \over Rtarget * P$ <br />OR<br /> $max(R_5,R_4) \over Rtarget * P$ Default: $Rcurrent \over Rtarget * 0.8$| The extent to which the trajectory has reached 80% of the recovery target value. The metric commonly uses the maximum value from the 4th or 5th year of restoration window to show the extent to which a pixel has reached 80% of the target value 5 years into the restoration window, however for monitoring purposes, this tool uses the current time step or last year of the time series to provide up to date recovery progress. 80% of the recovery target value is the default, however this can be changed by modifying the value of P. |
| Y2R (Years to recovery) | $i where R_i= Rtarget*P$ <br /> Default:<br /> $i where R_i= Rtarget*0.8$| The length of time taken (in time steps/years) for a given pixel to reach 80% of its recovery target value. The percent can be modified by changing the value of P. |
| RRI (Relative recovery index) |$max(R_5,R_4)-R_0 \over D_s-D_e$| A modified version of the commonly used RI, the RRI accounts for noise in trajectory by using the maximum from the 4th or 5th year in monitoring window. The metric relates recovery magnitude to disturbance magnitude, and is the change in index value in 4 or 5 years divided by the change due to disturbance. |

A choice of metrics is included to make the outputs applicable to different research or monitoring objectives, and offer differing information. ∆Indexregrowth quantifies the absolute change during a restoration window, whilst YrYr uses this absolute change to derive an average annual rate of change. R80P allows for the quantification of recovery progress relative to a recovery target, while the Y2R metric reveals how long it took for the recovery process to occur. RRI is distinct from other metrics, as it relates the change during the restoration window to the change due to the disturbance, essentially scaling the recovery to the disturbance severity (Frazier et al. 2018). Thus, the tool's range of metrics can offer complementary information concerning a restoration site's recovery.

This tool produces raster outputs that allow for the visualization of per-pixel recovery metrics. This enables a clear understanding of the recovery progress across an entire landscape. Subsequent spatial analyses using these tool outputs can include measures of spatial autocorrelation with external variables, cluster analyses, or measures of spatial heterogeneity. This could prove useful to identifying any spatial patterns or trends in recovery in the landscape, or the potential to identify which external factors (such as restoration treatments, topography, soil, dominant species, precipitation, etc.) are more significant drivers of ecological recovery. Conversely, this can also aid in the identification of areas that could require further restoration activities to aid in the recovery process.

The tool also provides per-polygon recovery metrics, which summarize the progress of the restoration site as a whole. This informs on how well the recovery is progressing generally and includes measures such as percent recovered. Percent of a restoration site recovered could be a valuable measure of success by itself, as restoration practitioners may simply require a certain percentage (e.g., 80%) of a restoration site to reach recovery target values to determine that no further management efforts are necessary.

# 6. TOOL CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS

This section aims to outline some recommended key considerations and transparent discussion of the tool's limitations.

The use of satellite imagery may underestimate or overestimate recovery due to its spatial resolution relative to the spatial structure of vegetation recovery processes. Mangewa et al. (2022) found that habitat conditions were underestimated using Sentinel-2 10 m satellite imagery compared with approximately 8.5 cm resolution aerial-based imagery, also finding that while satellite imagery was able to detect the class of very good habitat conditions successfully, it was not as able to detect the poor or very poor condition classes. Generally, the result due to mixed pixels, is an overestimation of moderate condition vegetation (Mangewa et al. 2022). While using the tool, it is beneficial to keep in mind the resolution of the data and the implications for detail the imagery can reveal. Depending on the habitat, Sentinel-2 may offer advantages in revealing spatial heterogeneity of recovery that is not possible with Landsat.

Spectral indices have long been proven effective at estimating the conditions of vegetation (Huete et al., 2002; Key & Benson, 2006; Vogelmann et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2022), however they provide an estimation of vegetation health using spectral indices as a proxy as opposed to a direct measurement of a recovery attribute such as vegetation height or stem density. Thus, the outputs of the tool should be validated using ground measurements, or external datasets such as those derived from LiDAR. For instance, rapid recovery of NDVI could indicate that native or natural vegetation is returning to an area after disturbance, but it could also mean that an invasive species has taken advantage of a lack of competition, which would then result in slower recovery rates and the disruption of successional stages (Burnett et al., 2019). However, a study by White et al. (2022) found that spectral recovery (of NBR) was successful in predicting recovery of structural attributes such as canopy cover and tree height, so it is still reasonable to assume relative accuracy in recovery estimation using multiple spectral indices.

Some spectral indices may not be appropriate due to geographical locations of the study sites or their ecosystems, or even due to the satellite images available. While a guide for the indices has been compiled with common limitations of each index (see the section on Spectral Indices), it is encouraged to research the use of each index for specific ecosystems and forest types to ensure compatibility and efficacy in results.

 It is advisable to be critical in the interpretation of the results. Positive change in a spectral index does not necessarily equal recovery (as in the invasive species example mentioned above), and consistently high measures of the indices may not be desirable either. For example, if the aim of the restoration is to improve biodiversity and species richness, then it is perhaps more desirable for there to be variability in the spectral indices across the landscape. Variability in NDVI values, for instance, have shown to be correlated to habitat heterogeneity (Gould, 2000).

 Generally, the individual goals of each restoration project vary, and so the interpretation of the results should subsequently vary. The tool allows for a better general understanding of landscape conditions, with different spectral indices providing differing information. The tool output could be used in a subsequent analysis, with different data such as soil, climate, species, or habitat information overlaid, to further identify recovery progress in light of environmental variables.
