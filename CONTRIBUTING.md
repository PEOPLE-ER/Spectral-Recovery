# Contributing

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

# Pull Request Process

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

2. Ensure your code has been formatted using [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), and linted using [flake-8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
   
3. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of changes to the code, or APIs. This includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
   
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the CHANGELOG.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
   
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two project maintainers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

# Report Bugs Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub Issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/PEOPLE-ER/Cloud-Free-Composites/issues/new/choose).

## Bug Reporting Guidelines

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Provide a minimal working example showcasing the bug.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or fixes you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports.

# Use a Consistent Coding Style

## Python 

For all Python code, adhere to PEP8 Standards, to double check your code adheres to PEP8 Standards lint your code before submitting a Pull Request. Do this using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). 
Function docstrings should be formatted using the [Google Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
